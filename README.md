# IITK-Mini-MIPS

This project was submitted as part of coursework for **CS220: Computer Organization** during Semester II, 2024â€“25 at **IIT Kanpur**.  

---

## Overview
**IITK-Mini-MIPS** is a simulation tool built to interpret and execute **MIPS assembly code**.  
It models the behavior of a processor using a **5-stage pipeline architecture** as a reference framework, but executes instructions step-by-step.  

The project serves as an **educational model** to explore how different stages of instruction processing work in modern processors.

## Execution Stages

### 1. Instruction Fetch (IF)
- **Goal:** Retrieve the next instruction from memory using the Program Counter (PC).  
- **Details:** Instruction memory holds a sequence of MIPS instructions, which are fetched and passed on for decoding.  

### 2. Instruction Decode (ID)
- **Goal:** Interpret the instruction and prepare for execution.  
- **Details:** Identifies instruction type (R-type, I-type, J-type), extracts operands, and sets up control signals.  

### 3. Execution / ALU (EX)
- **Goal:** Perform arithmetic or address computations.  
- **Details:** Handles operations like integer multiplication, floating-point subtraction, and address calculation for memory access.  

### 4. Memory Access (MEM)
- **Goal:** Read from or write to data memory (if required).  
- **Details:** Applies to load/store instructions; others skip this phase.  

### 5. Write Back (WB)
- **Goal:** Store the result in the register file or memory.  
- **Details:** Final results from ALU or memory are written to their destination (e.g., registers), completing the instruction lifecycle.
